PlaceNext is an event-driven, multi-tenant application built with a focus on clean architecture and modern development practices. This repository contains the complete source code for the backend services that power the platform.

‚ú® Features
Role-Based Access Control: Distinct user roles for Students, Faculty, and Company Employees, each with specific permissions.

Job Posting & Application: Companies can create detailed job postings with specific criteria, which colleges can then approve and pass on to students.

Multi-Round Tracking: Manages the entire interview process, from initial application to clearing multiple rounds.

Event-Driven Notifications: A decoupled notification system that informs users of important events, such as a new job posting or a change in application status.

üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The PlaceNext backend is a Layered, Event-Driven Monolith, designed to be scalable and easy to maintain. This architecture allows for clear separation of concerns and can be broken down into microservices in the future if needed.

Key Architectural Concepts
Layered Design:

Routing: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate controller.

Middleware: Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication (Firebase Auth), authorization (role checks), and request validation.

Controllers: Orchestrate the workflow for a request. They parse the input, call the necessary business logic, and format the final HTTP response. They are kept "thin" and do not contain business logic themselves.

Models: The Mongoose schemas are the single source of truth for our data structures and handle all interactions with the MongoDB database.

Design Patterns: We use design patterns extensively to create a decoupled and maintainable system.

Observer Pattern: This is the core of our communication system. When a job is created or approved, an event is emitted. Separate, decoupled services (like NotificationService or CollegeService) listen for these events and react accordingly. This prevents a "spiderweb" of dependencies.

Strategy Pattern: Used to handle different logic for different user roles, especially in authentication. The StudentAuth and FacultyAuth strategies allow for unique signup and signin processes without cluttering the controller with if/else statements.

Factory Pattern: Used to abstract the creation of complex objects. For instance, an OrganisationFactory can create either a College or Company document from a single endpoint, hiding the instantiation logic from the controller.

Proxy Pattern: Used to add a layer of control over actions. For job approvals, a JobApprovalProxy first checks if the user has the required permissions before delegating the actual approval task to the core logic.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Language: TypeScript

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

Authentication: Firebase Admin SDK for token verification

Environment Management: dotenv

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)

A running MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

A Google Firebase project with a generated service account key (.json file).

Local Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/placenext-server.git
cd placenext-server
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root.

Add the necessary configuration variables. Your FIREBASE_CRED must be the entire content of your Firebase service account JSON file, formatted as a single-line string.

.env example:

# Server configuration
PORT=8000

# MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/placenext

# Firebase Admin SDK credentials (as a single line string)
FIREBASE_CRED={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n...\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n","client_email":"...","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"...","token_uri":"...","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"...","client_x509_cert_url":"..."}
Compile TypeScript and Run:

This project uses tsc to compile TypeScript to JavaScript.

Add the following scripts to your package.json:

JSON

"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node dist/index.js",
  "dev": "tsc -w & nodemon dist/index.js"
},
Run the build command:

Bash

npm run build
Start the server:

Bash

npm start
The server should now be running at http://localhost:8000.

ü§ù How to Contribute
We are excited to welcome contributors! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth process.

Contribution Workflow
Fork the repository and clone it locally.

Create an issue on GitHub describing the feature or bug you want to work on.

Create a new branch from main for your work (git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature).

Make your changes. Please adhere to the architectural principles and coding style.

Write tests for any new functionality.

Ensure all tests pass.

Push your branch to your fork and create a Pull Request back to the main repository. Link the PR to the issue you created.

Coding Standards
TypeScript: All code must be in TypeScript with strict typing. Avoid any whenever possible.

Architecture: Respect the existing layered architecture. Business logic should be placed in services or pattern implementations, not directly in controllers.

Commit Messages: Use conventional commit messages (e.g., feat: Add job application endpoint, fix: Correct notification payload).

Decoupling: Use the event emitter to communicate between different domains (e.g., jobs and notifications) rather than creating direct dependencies.
